Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 6
  A[3] = 4
  A[4] = 1
  A[5] = 2

the function should return 5.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.

def solution(A):
    N = len(A)
    count = [0]*(N + 1)

    # Counts all elements of A tha belongs to sequence {1, ..., N}
    for k in range(N):
	if N >= A[k] > 0:
            count[A[k]] += 1

    # Searches for the lesser integer that not belongs to A
    for k in range(1, N + 1):
        if count[k] == 0:
            return k

    # If A has all elements from 1 to N, N + 1 is the minimal integer
    return N + 1
